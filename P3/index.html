        <div class="panel">
          <p>Connection is the fundamental cornerstone of the internet; it is both bought and sold through time spent and retention. Connection is the value proposition that keeps the internet growing at an exponential rate. We all strive to stay connected, but, in essence, we can go without connection as long as we can consume. The fundamental architecture of the internet infers connection, physically, this plays out through a global infrastructure of controlled binary exchange.
              <br>
            The writing by Kenneth Goldsmith  If it Doesnt Exist on the Internet, It Doesnt Exist, explicates the idea of interconnectivity as it applies to realism and surrealism on the internet. There is a socialized notion that an individual must be present, must be live, or online in order to indicate their aliveness. What’s more is the understanding that the internet is an interconnected repository, but said repository has no obligation to be representative nor unbiased.
            <br>
            Connection is at the core fundaments of the internets usage, and these interconnected systems come in many shapes, hierarchies and sizes; the most predominant of which is the centralized network. A notion that cant be disentangled from the capitalist ideologies imbued on the internet. There are decentralized systems and architectures, but that are still constrained by our prototypical expectations of the Internet; a blockchain network still leverages itself based on some centralized institution like a bank for example.     </p>

        <button class="accordion">INT_OBJECT_02 MEDIA</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>The relationship and interplay between media and its predominant architecture is something that the internet has exemplified. There is a symbiosis between the media we consume and the framework or platform that holds it; it is a reciprocal cycle. Moreover artifacts and instances of media is made to be highly reproducible and accessible through compression, file formatting, cropping, etc. Some would argue that an honest piece of media is one that implicates the way it is shared.
            <br>
            Hito Steyerl argues for an honest representation of the image in her writing on the subject. The poor image is one that directly addresses the systemic ways in which it’s reproduced. Conversely, the high quality, uncompressed, image hides the nature of its display. Memes and highly trafficked media address the weight of their reproduction and naturally find success through the connectivity of the media.
            <br>
            Whether or not the dissemination of media is democratic is another discussion, it can be argued that the most honest forms of media are, through aesthetics and form, elevated and platformed based on the nature of their content, but there are too many examples of irresponsible, misinformed media beating out honest forms of content. This contradiction is thanks in part to the idea of a centralized network, a unified authority which can prioritize and elevate certain forms of media over others.
